//console.log ('prova')

//EX 1

const number = 100; //this variable *number* will contain the number *100*
console.log(number);

//EX 2

const pi = 3.14; //this variable *pi* will contain the number *3.14*
console.log(pi);

//EX 2/B

/* 

const pi = 3.1416;  
console.log(pi);

In this case i'm reciving an error from the console because the variable *pi* is a constant and cannot be defined only once. 
To fix this problem i can modify my variable const whit a variable log
